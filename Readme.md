## Problem Statement
Farmers often struggle to identify crop diseases early, leading to significant yield loss. This model automates disease detection using plant leaf images, helping farmers take timely action. The goal is to classify *X disease classes* across *Y crop types* with high accuracy. Allowing farmers to detect the disease in a timely manner and take steps to reduce or conttain losses.

## Model Architecture

We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on a VGG-like structure with batch normalization and a classification head to help us in image clssification and disease detection.

## Usage
The Model can be used by passing the image of a suspected infection on leaf of the plant and be used to detect possible disease. However the model is only trained on limited number of disease and data hence the model accuracy is higher for the the data it is trained on which are 12 disease, but the model will produce false positive for other diseases. 

---

## Results 
The model upon succesfull training is able to identify 12 plant disease based on the image of the affected area of the leaf with 98% accuracy and 7% loss.
